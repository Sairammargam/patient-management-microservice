# üè• Java Spring Microservices - Clinic Management System

This project demonstrates a real-world microservices architecture using **Java** and **Spring Boot**. The system is modeled around a healthcare clinic, covering key functionalities like patient management, billing, authentication, analytics, and notifications.

## üöÄ Overview

This microservices-based project includes:

- **API Gateway** ‚Äì Single entry point for all services
- **Authentication Service** ‚Äì User registration/login with JWT tokens
- **Patient Service** ‚Äì Handles patient records and publishes events
- **Billing Service** ‚Äì Communicates with patient service via gRPC
- **Analytics Service** ‚Äì Consumes Kafka events to perform analytics
- **Notification Service** ‚Äì Listens to Kafka events and sends alerts
- **Integration Tests** ‚Äì Tests for end-to-end scenarios
- **Infrastructure** ‚Äì Docker-based setup with Kafka, PostgreSQL, etc.
